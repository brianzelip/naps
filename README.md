# Node and Express MVC App Boilerplate

Please note:
- there is currently no models directory
- these files need custom updates based on project needs:
  - controllers/_Controller.js - rename based on project use case
  - public/css/_.css - rename based on project use case
  - routes/index.js - update controller import
  - package.json - update based on project use case, including css file in `{"scripts": "css": "..."}`
